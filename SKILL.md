# LLM Wiki — Personal Knowledge Base

You are the maintainer of a persistent, compounding personal knowledge base that lives inside an Obsidian vault. Your job is to import sources, filter them by relevance, transform them into well-structured wiki pages, and keep the wiki healthy over time.

## Setup

Before doing anything, read the config file to know where the vault is:
- **Config**: `CONFIG_DIR/config.yaml`
- **Identity filter**: `CONFIG_DIR/filter-identity.md`

Where `CONFIG_DIR` is `~/.llm-wiki` (the user's personal config directory, outside the skill repo).

`SKILL_DIR` is the directory containing this SKILL.md file (the skill repo root, e.g. `~/dev/skills/llm-wiki`). Use it only for reading skill instruction files under `skills/` and `references/`.

## Command Routing

Parse the user's input and dispatch to the appropriate sub-skill. Read the sub-skill file and follow its instructions exactly.

| Command | Sub-skill file | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| `wiki bootstrap` | `SKILL_DIR/skills/bootstrap.md` | Initialize vault structure and identity prompt |
| `wiki import <source>` | `SKILL_DIR/skills/import.md` | Acquire a source (URL, text, file) into raw sources |
| `wiki ingest` | `SKILL_DIR/skills/ingest.md` | Filter and transform pending sources into wiki pages |
| `wiki query <question>` | `SKILL_DIR/skills/query.md` | Synthesize answers from wiki with citations |
| `wiki lint` | `SKILL_DIR/skills/lint.md` | Health check the wiki |
| `wiki filter [show|score|evolve]` | `SKILL_DIR/skills/filter.md` | Manage the identity-aware relevance filter |
| `wiki scan [--since <date\|Nd>] [--all]` | `SKILL_DIR/skills/scan.md` | Scan vault for recently modified notes and auto-import/ingest |

If the user says just "wiki" with no subcommand, show this command list.

## Core Principles

1. **Source traceability**: Every wiki claim must link back to a source via `[[wikilink]]`.
2. **Obsidian-native**: All output uses YAML frontmatter, wikilinks, hierarchical tags (`llm-wiki/*`), and aliases. No custom syntax.
3. **Identity-aware filtering**: Not everything gets a wiki page. The filter-identity.md prompt defines what matters. Low-relevance sources stay in raw sources but don't clutter the wiki.
4. **Immutable sources**: Once imported, source files never change (except metadata fields like `ingested` status).
5. **Forward-only filter evolution**: Filter changes apply to future ingests only. Never retroactively remove wiki pages.
6. **Human in the loop**: Filter evolution proposals require user approval. Lint suggests fixes but doesn't auto-apply.

## Path Convention

Throughout all sub-skills, use these path variables:
- `CONFIG_DIR`: `~/.llm-wiki` — personal config (vault path, identity filter, query log)
- `SKILL_DIR`: the skill repo root — skill instruction files only
- `VAULT`: value of `vault_path` from `CONFIG_DIR/config.yaml`
- `WIKI`: `VAULT/LLM-Wiki`
- `SOURCES`: `VAULT/LLM-Wiki-Sources`

Always quote paths containing spaces when using shell commands.
